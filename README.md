# Important
This repository will house the documents that are important to the development of this project, including the coding style, configs and etc.

# Structure
The project is structured very uniquely. There is an organisation that will house the repositories, with different sizable components being different repositories that should contain the different products/applications.

We expect to have currently the following repositories:
* The C# WindowsForms application.
* The ASP.NET Backend
* The Class Library

The editor configuration ![[.editorconfig|.editorconfig]] is to be used for the project as the code standard enforcer.

The preferred IDEs for development are up to the developer's choice. Suggested IDEs are:
* Visual Studio Code
* Visual Studio
* Vim/Nvim
